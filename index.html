        <p>Pepe the meme is a green cartoon frog that became an internet sensation in the early 2010s. Originally created by artist Matt Furie for his comic series "Boy's Club," Pepe was adopted by internet users who turned him into a symbol of humor, irony, and absurdity. Pepe memes often feature the frog in various humorous situations, such as wearing a "feels good man" t-shirt or crying uncontrollably. However, Pepe's innocent origins were overshadowed by its association with far-right movements, such as the alt-right, and the Anti-Defamation League classified it as a hate symbol in 2016.</p>
        <p>Despite its controversial association with hate groups, many internet users still create and share Pepe memes as a form of satire and social commentary. Some argue that the meme's initial innocence and playful nature have been lost due to its politicization, while others see it as a prime example of the internet's ability to appropriate and subvert cultural symbols.</p>
        <p>In recent years, there have been efforts to reclaim Pepe from its negative connotations. In 2017, the #SavePepe campaign was launched, aiming to promote the positive aspects of the meme and dissociate it from hate speech. Additionally, Furie has taken legal action against alt-right groups that used Pepe without his permission and created a new comic series to showcase the character's original spirit.In recent years, there have been efforts to reclaim Pepe from its negative connotations.
